    <h3> Zai Scott</h3>

    

    <p>If you thought you were a gamer, then you never met this guy. His first memory that he remembers vividly was of him playing MarioKart, not even his own parent. XD. His dedication to be a couch potato and waste his life platying games makes him a perfect candidate to be our head reviewer.</p>

    <h3> Jack Pharies</h3>

    

    <p>A gamer since a kid, Jack enjoyed the more casual gamign and often was upset about the super competitve nature, thus took up a vendetta against the super competitve games, thats why he is perfect for Harsh Reviews</p>
